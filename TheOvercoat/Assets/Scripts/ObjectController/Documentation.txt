_ClickAndDrag.cs
_Dependent to:

This script enable player to drag object with mouse.

_FollowCamera.cs

_ChangeKeyShapesWithMouse
_Dependent to: SkinnedMeshRenderer

This script enables player to change blend key of object with mouse position.

_ChangeMaterial
_Dependent to: Material, Renderer

This script changes material of object. It gets the new material from public list. It basically changes to next material from List. If current material is last one then it turns to first Material of List.

_KeySliderCompeletly
_Dependent to: SkinnedMeshRenederer,

This script increases blend key to 100 or decreases to 0.

_MaterialPropertyAutomaticSlider
_Dependent to: Material

This script increases and decreases a porperty of material contionusly.

_Throw
_Dependent to: RigidBody
_param Vector3 force: Force that will be applied.

This script aplies uncontionus force on object.

_CollectableObject.cs
_Dependent to: 

This script enable player to collect parent object with mouse click.
Collected objects saved to a static List of this class.

_EnableAndDisableRigidBody
Dependent to: _Rigidbody

This scripts enables and disables rb. It has public methods enable and disable.

_LerpToPosition: aim

This scripts moves object to aim gameObject position. It can rotate object and can make projectile movement.

_ObjectChildSpawn: prefabObj

This scripts instantiates prefabObj as a child of owner obj.	

_RandomWalkBot.cs
Dependent to: RoadObject, NavMeshAgent

This script makes object randomly walk on RoadObject. It generates random position on road and set agent destination to that position when object finish its path. WaitbetweenWalks makes object wait when it finish its path before starting to new path. Tolerance affects finish condition of obj.
Also interruptAndWa≈ülAgain can be called outside to change destination of object from outside.

Dependent to: Renderer, Material
This scripts makes transparent objects that are between camera and target object or player. For usage originalMaterial and tranparent material must be assigned. Also target objects must assign too.

_SpawnBotsOnTheRoad.cs

This scripts spawns assigned prefabs randomly in random position. Number of spawn can be assigned with spawnNumber parameter. Also if prefab includes NavMeshAgent it arrange its speed randomly between min and max speed.

_SpawnObjectInSphere.cs
Dependent to: SphereCollider, randomMovement

This script spawns prefab with a numberOfSpawn times in sphere collider in random position. If child has randomMovement script it adjust its speed with speed parameter.

_SplashWhenHitSomehing
Dependent to: ParticleSystemObject, ParticleSystem

This scripts gets collision points when an object collides with it and moves particleSystem to that point. After movement it plays particle system one time.

_WalkToFarestOfRoadBot
Dependent to: NavMeshAgent, RoadObject

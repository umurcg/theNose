_LerpToPosition: aim

This scripts moves object to aim gameObject position. It can rotate object and can make projectile movement.

_ObjectChildSpawn: prefabObj

This scripts instantiates prefabObj as a child of owner obj.	

_RandomWalkBot.cs
Dependent to: RoadObject, NavMeshAgent

This script makes object randomly walk on RoadObject. It generates random position on road and set agent destination to that position when object finish its path. WaitbetweenWalks makes object wait when it finish its path before starting to new path. Tolerance affects finish condition of obj.
Also interruptAndWa≈ülAgain can be called outside to change destination of object from outside.

_SeeBehindWall.cs
Dependent to: Renderer, Material
This scripts makes transparent objects that are between camera and target object or player. For usage originalMaterial and tranparent material must be assigned. Also target objects must assign too.

_SpawnBotsOnTheRoad.cs

_Dependent to: NevMeshAgent

This script sets player object movement when player clicks to parent object.
If player is in nearby(radius parameter specifies that) of parent object Action function of IClickAction interface is called.
Else player start to move towards to parent object and then Action function is called.


_PlayerComponentController.cs
_Depentent to: _CharacterControllerKeyboard.cs, _CharacterLook.cs, _MoveTo.cs

This script controlles main player object's scripts for disabling and enabling movement of object.

_MoveTo.cs
_Dependent to: NavMeshAgent

This script enable player to move player object with mouse clicks.
It uses NavMeshAgent for movements.

_OnEnterTrigger.cs
_Dependent to:

This script calls TriggerAction from IClickTrigger interface when player object enter parent collider.

_SpaceTrigger.cs

_randomMovement.cs
_Dependent to:

This scripts moves child objects randomly in collider of parent object.

Rotate_Object

_Special_Controllers_
These scripts controls specific tasks. Generally they are used only one time. They can be dependent a lot of think, therefore also can be very fragile.

_IvanHouseBreadCameraEnabler.cs

Bu arada bu olayin söylentileri tüm sehirde yayilmaya baslamaistir.
Öykü en ufak ayrintisina dek sisirlerek analtiliyordu.
Zaten o siralar halk arasinda oglaganüstü seylere karsi bir merak vardi
Daha cok yakin zamanda manyetizma üzerine deneyler halk arasinda konusuluyordu. 
Ve daha Konusenneya sokaginda ki dans eden sandalyeler hikayesi hala dillerdeydi.
Bu nedenle kimse Müdür yardimcisi Kovalev'in burnun her aksam 3 gibi sokaklarda gezmesine sasirmamistir.
Ama evrenin akan bir nehir oldugu unutlmamalidir. Ve bu nehirin akisini hesaplamak ne yazik ki hic bir varligin yapabilecegi bir is degildir.
Su dünya cok garip seylere kadir. Ve bu oyunda gecen olaylara inanmazsaniz sizi hor görmem. Ancak gene oglaganüstü bir sekilde bir gün Bay Kovalev kalktiginda , önceki gece masasinda biraktigi burunu yerinde bulmustur. Yani iki yanaginin tam ortasinda. Bu olay 7 Nisan'da gerceklesti.
Gördügünüz gibi büyücülerin ve doktorlarin yapamadigi seyi nehrin kendisi yapmis ve su yolunu bir sekilde bulmustur.
Ama ne yazik ki insanoglunun nankörlügü tekrar gün yüzüne cikmistir ve nehrin icinde yüzenlerin hayati böyle bir oglaganüstü hikayeden sonra bile hemen eski haline dönmüstür.

Meanwhile, rumors of this incident started to spread out whole city.
Story was being told with exaggerating even slightest details.
As a matter of fact, in these times there were interests to unnatural incidents.
Mainly people were talking about experiments related to magnetism. Magnetism was seen as an unnatural phenomenon that is brought by devil.
And people still were talking about the woman making chairs dance with her hand movements in Konusenneya street.
For that reason, nobody was too much surprised while Major's nose was walking around in streets every night at 3 o'clock.
But nobody must forget that universe is river that flows forever. And unfortunately predicting the current of this river was under non of mortal being's capability.
This world is able to very strange things. And if you don't believe the events that is lived in this story, I wouldn't blame you. B
But again in an extraordinary way, one morning Major Kovalev found his nose that he put last night on his bedside, on his original place. Between his two cheeks. This happened in 7th of April.
As you can understand, the think that can't be done by doctor and witch was done by river itself and you can see all rivers fall into sea somehow.
But sadly mankind again shows his ungratefulness as always, and even after an extraordinary story like this; people who swim in the river, somehow returns their old life suddenly.

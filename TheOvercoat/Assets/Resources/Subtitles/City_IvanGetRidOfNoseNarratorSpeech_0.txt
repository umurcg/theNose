Ivan sokaga dehset bir sekilde cikti. Hemen burundan kurtulmayi düsünüyordu.
Aklindan bir sürü fikir geciyordu. Önünde karmasik kocaman canli bir varlik olan St Petersburg sehri sokaklariyla ona burundan kurtulmak icin milyonlarca secenek sunuyordu. 
Tek yapmasi gereken aynasizlardan birine yakalanmadan, burundan ona bir daha geri dönmeyecek sekilde  kurtulmakti.

ENG
Ivan gets out to street desperately. He is terrified with idea of being arrested by police.
He was already imagining the brightness of that beautiful sharp sword and shaking all over.
He thinks to stuff it away as soon as possible. But how?
Lots of options come to his mind; hiding it between stones or "accidentally" dropping it while walking on the street...
The city in front of his steps; St Petersburg, offer millions of options to save his miserable life.
Only think he must do is finding he right way of getting rid of the nose without to being captured by pigs.

Feliks: Hey sen dur orada!
Feliks: Sen ne koydun öyle armutlarin arasina.
Feliks: Yoksa seni yan tarafta ki Rinat mi gönderdi?
Feliks: Söyle o edepsize artik benim islerimi bozamiyacak.
Feliks: Al hemen lanet olasica ne üdügü belirsi seyi ve hemen burdan uzaklas.
Ivan: Arkadas ne kiziyorsun hemen. Yerde buldum senin tezgahindan düsmüstür diye geri koydum.
Ivan: Bu devirde iyilik de yaramiyor kimseye.

Feliks: Hey you!. Stop there.
Feliks: What did you put between pears?
Feliks: Did Rinat sent you from next stand?
Feliks: Tell that ominous man, he can not ruin my sales. He is always jealous of my running position on the street. 
Feliks: But no. He can not take my point on my watch! Take that bloody think and get out off my face.
Ivan: Hey pal, why you get angry to me. I just found it at ground and thought that it might fell down from your stand.
Ivan: I was being a helpful citizen but I think you can not make any favor in these times.

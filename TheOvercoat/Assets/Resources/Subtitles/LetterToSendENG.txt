Dear Mrs Alexandra Grigoryevna, 

I cannot understand this strange behaviour on your part. You can be sure, though, that it won’t get you anywhere and you certainly won’t force me to marry your daughter. Moreover, you can rest assured that, regarding my nose, I am familiar with the whole history of this affair from the very beginning, and I also know that you, and no one else, are the prime instigator. Its sudden detachment from its rightful place, its subsequent flight, its masquerading as a civil servant and then its re-appearance in its natural state, are nothing else than the result of black magic carried out by yourself or by those practicing the same very honorouble art. I consider it my duty to warn you that if the above-mentioned nose is not back in its proper place by today, then I shall be compelled to ask for the law’s protection. I remain, dear Madam, 

Your very faithful servant, 

Platon Kovalyov

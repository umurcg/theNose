Bir sabah uyandigimda yüzümden kayboldun
Ve sensiz birden kokulari duyamaz oldum
En önemli islevindi solunum
Neredesin benim güzel burunum?
Sokaklarda aradim seni, herkese duyurdum.
Bazilari görmüs seni, kiyafetlerin cok masum.
Nedir  bana cektirdigin bu korkunc zulüm.
Neredesin benim güzel burunum?

One morning, when I woke up you were lost.
And without you all the odours were frost.
Respiration was your job at most.
Where are you now my beautiful nose
I searched you on the streets, everybody were told.
Some of them saw you, your uniform was innocuous.
What is the misery that you put me, it is tort.
Where are you now my beautiful nose
